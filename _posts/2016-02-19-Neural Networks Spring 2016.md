### Introduction
This course is written specifically for one of my friend and not for commercial purpose. 
This course talks about neural networks from a programmer perspective so it contains a lot of programming practices. 
Due to my limited English, the first version of this course will be in Vietnamese. I will try to translate it to English later.
