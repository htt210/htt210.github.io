## Volume Conservation in Deep Nets
Many works suggested that volume conservation is important for deep nets to learn effectively. [1] argued that ResNet, LSTM, Highway nets are all based on this idea. 
Information theoretic view of a mapping:
$$Y = H(X)$$
Xavier initialization also tries to keeps the variance of the output to be the same as that of the inputs. That's another form of coservation.
