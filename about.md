Hello there
I'm Hoang ThanhTung, a machine learning enthusiast from Vietnam. I love Machine Learning, open source and sharing.

### Brief Bio

I studied Computer Science at VNU, Hanoi from 2008 to 2012. I worked at several universities in Singapore before joining Deakin University in 2017 as a PhD student.

I am mostly interested in the theoretical aspects of deep learning systems. My PhD focuses on the convergence and generalization properties of Deep Generative Models.
